   - Needed: Actual test files & Jest configuration
   - Action: Create when tests are written

3. **Monitoring Setup** (Priority: Medium)
   - Current: Tools listed (Sentry, Vercel Analytics)
   - Needed: Configuration & alerting setup
   - Action: Document when monitoring deployed

4. **API Specifications** (Priority: Low)
   - Current: Routes listed in README
   - Needed: OpenAPI/Swagger spec
   - Action: Generate from code or create separately

5. **Database Migrations** (Priority: Medium)
   - Current: Schema documented
   - Needed: Migration files & procedures
   - Action: Document schema changes as they happen
